# Interactive Cubic Bezier and <br/> B-spline Simulator
### by Zaid Albustami

To run via terminal (in root dir):  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```mkdir build```  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```cmake ..```  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```make```  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```./bin/Spline```

This project is base code for a 3D visualization tool for higher  
order bspline meshes currently only supporting cubic  
Future plans:  
Quartic and quantic
More spline types e.g hermite  
Coordinate inputs and clear plane with units  
Sample size slider
